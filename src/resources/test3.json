Neither does the horned office worker in front of you, typing away at the only desk. You see red high-heels peek out below the desk, and an arrow-tipped tail occasionally flicks into sight. It takes a while before the weary worker notices you.</i> Hm? Another deceased? Call me The Devil. I am the proprietor of this plane of perpetual suffering known as Hell. My favourite form of sleep is REM sleep. I’ve been so busy that I’ve hardly slept...not enough manpower...I want to sleep!\nStill here? My office is Limbo, but outside is Hell. You may leave at any time. Given your <em>particular</em> constitution, however, you might not last very long....\n->Uh, hello?\n\t...I said florals, Karen! Oh, just a dream. Where was I?\n\tI say I rule Hell, but I really just lease the space. My full-time work is in the fashion industry. Like my shoes? They’re Prada. I like them almost as much as I like sleep.\n\t-> I prefer Gucci\n\t\tThey’re fine too. I monopolise both Prada and Gucci, you know, to fool the populace about the true political landscape of the fashion industry. The stock price for Gucci even recently went up 0.02%.... <i>The Devil starts snoring.</i>\n\t\t[[What about the stock prices?|StockPrices]]\n\t\t[[<i>Do nothing</i>|DoNothing]]\n\t\t[[<i>Leave the office</i>|LeaveOffice]]\n\t[[<i>Leave the office</i>|LeaveOffice]]\n[[<i>Leave the office</i>|leaveOffice]]\n",
