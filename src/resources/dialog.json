Right...\n-> <i>Keep silent</i>\nAs a kid, I liked the look of them, liked tounching them, and I especially liked bashing them together. As I grew older, of course, my taste in rocks became more refined:\nNaturally, I became a miner.\n-> Not a geologist?\n\tA what? Look, I'm trying to tell a story\n-> <i>Keep silent</i>\nI was the best. You couldn't find another man for miles who could hurl a pick like me. Oh, you should have seen me. I could make the iron flow like the Acheron.\nEvery morning my men and I would descend upon the stone with our axes and make music which rivaled the muses. <i>He curls his toes around a pebble near his feet and passes it to his hand. He begins to tap slowly and percussively against the boulder.</i> Sometimes I can still feel the rhythm in my bones.\nEverything I said to you before was true: the blood pumping, the body aching. It was all there in the mines.\nIt filled me with such joy. Every night when I returned to my wife, I felt like having a celebratory feast. Of course the food was never so bountiful, but we feasted nonetheless.\nMy wife always warned me about the dangers of mining and hard labor when we first married—she was a healer by trade—but I think my attitude soon convinced her otherwise.\nMy life was built around rocks, and she understood. <i>He pauses and looks away, and seems to fill the whole cave with his gaze.<i/>\n-> I still feel like there's more to this\n\tI'm getting to it.\n-> So that's it, live by the rock, die by the rock?\n\tThere's more to it than that\n-> I get the sense that your life ended around rocks too\n\tSometimes I wish that were true, snowball...\nLook, one day I just hit the wrong rock in just the wrong way. A torrent of stone came down on me. Or, it must have, I don't remember a thing until I was in my bed screaming.\nMen like me weren't usually saved. We were given a merciful death, mourned, and turned into vague memories.\nBut my wife would have none of it. I think I hear her say \"I won't have my love killed by the very thing he loves. I couldn't bear it,\" while she tended my wounds, but I could have been dreaming.\nIt took days of work and many doctors, but they set my final fracture. It would be months, though, before I could even walk.\nAnd even then, everything was different.\nYou don't know what it's like being bed-ridden, and then confined to terrible crutches. At first I thought the pain would be the worst of it, but it was the stillness.\nMy children could be playing in the yard, and I could only watch. My wife could be going out for food—that's all she had time for after tending to me—and I could only wait.\nI was a waste. For her and my children.\nAnd I hated her for that. I loved her, and she kept me alive, and I hated her for making me live without my body. Making me this leech on her life. My children's lives.\nI never told her that. I just let it fester while my children grew. They grew stronger as I grew sadder, and I know they could tell because they grew sadder too.\nI think that's why I'm here. If it isn't, then it should be.\nI hope I died long before my wife. She deserves a chance to live a life without my burden, a chance to raise our kids without a hunk of flesh weighing down on them.\n<i>He lets out a long, quiet sigh</i>\nAfter I got out of Limbo, I didn't know what to do. I'm not sure if I deserve punishment, but no one's given it to me yet. So I wait, rolling my boulder.
